## Predicting Chronic Hunger
 Building a regression model predicting Chronic Hunger using data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations


#### Executive Summary
This document presents an analysis of data concerning the annual prevalence of undernourishment at the country level. The analysis is based on 1401 observations, each containing indicators of a country's conditions potentially related to its prevalence of undernourishment.

The dataset is provided by Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. After exploring the data by calculating summary, descriptive statistics, and creating visualizations of the data, several potential relationships between a country's socioeconomic indicators and its prevalence of undernourishment were identified. After exploring the data, a regression model to predict a country's undernourishment from its features was created.
